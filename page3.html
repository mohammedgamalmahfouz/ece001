    <h1>DBMS Architecture</h1>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>The DBMS design depends upon its architecture. The basic client/server architecture is used to deal with a large number of PCs, web servers, database servers and other components that are connected with networks.</li>
        <li>The client/server architecture consists of many PCs and a workstation which are connected via the network.</li>
        <li>DBMS architecture depends upon how users are connected to the database to get their request done.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Types of DBMS Architecture</h1>
    <img width="50%" style="margin-left: 25%;" src="dbms-architecture.png" alt="">
    <p>Database architecture can be seen as a single tier or multi-tier. But logically, database architecture is of two types like: 2-tier architecture and 3-tier architecture.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In this architecture, the database is directly available to the user. It means the user can directly sit on the DBMS and uses it.</li>
                    <li>Any changes done here will directly be done on the database itself. It doesn't provide a handy tool for end users.</li>
                    <li>The 1-Tier architecture is used for development of the local application, where programmers can directly communicate with the database for the quick response.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The 2-Tier architecture is same as basic client-server. In the two-tier architecture, applications on the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. For this interaction, API's like: ODBC, JDBC are used.</li>
                    <li>The user interfaces and application programs are run on the client-side.</li>
                    <li>The server side is responsible to provide the functionalities like: query processing and transaction management.</li>
                    <li>To communicate with the DBMS, client-side application establishes a connection with the server side.</li>

            <td><ul>
                <li>The 3-Tier architecture contains another layer between the client and server. In this architecture, client can't directly communicate with the server.</li>
                <li>The application on the client-end interacts with an application server which further communicates with the database system.</li>
                <li>End user has no idea about the existence of the database beyond the application server. The database also has no idea about any other user beyond the application.</li>
                <li>The 3-Tier architecture is used in case of large web application.</li>
